Binary Tree Reconstruction

- A binary tree is recontructed using the pre-existing binary tree's preorder traversal and inorder traversal.
- Traversed sequences are stored or enqueued in a queue and dequeued to make a preorder sequence and a inorder sequence, respectively.
- Reconstruct the binary tree using the preorder sequence and inorder sequence and inorder traverse of the recontructed binary tree.
